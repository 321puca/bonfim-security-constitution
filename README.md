# Security Governance & SecOps Case Repository

## Authority Statement

This repository is governed by a formal security constitution, enforced governance principles, and documented decision records.

All contents are authoritative, auditable, and non-advisory.

Undocumented actions are considered invalid by default.

## Purpose

This repository documents a real-world, production-grade security governance case involving:

* API key exposure risk
* SecOps response
* GDPR-aligned decision-making
* Evidence-based remediation
* Architecture enforcement

It is designed for:

* Security leadership review
* Senior technical interviews
* Governance and compliance audits
* Institutional knowledge transfer

## Governance Chain

The authority flow is strictly hierarchical:

1. **Constitution**

   * `TREE-OF-AUTHORITY.md`

2. **Governance**

   * `GOVERNANCE-PRINCIPLES.md`

3. **Architecture Decisions**

   * `ADR/ADR-SEC-001.md`

4. **Risk & Incident Simulation**

   * `TTX/TTX-INDEX.md`
   * `TTX/TTX-SEC-2026-01.md`

5. **Case Study**

   * `CASE-SECOPS-API-KEY-MANAGEMENT.md`

Each layer inherits authority from the previous one.

* SecOps best practices
* GDPR (Articles 5, 25, 32)
