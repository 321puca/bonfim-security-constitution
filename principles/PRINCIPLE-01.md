# Principle 01 — Human Accountability and Deliberate Control

All security governance, architectural decisions, and operational actions are subject to explicit human accountability.

Automation, tooling, and artificial intelligence may assist analysis and execution, but they never replace human deliberation, authorization, or responsibility.

No system, process, or policy operates without a clearly identifiable human decision-maker accountable for its outcomes.
