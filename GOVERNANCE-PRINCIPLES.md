# Governance Principles

## 1. Role of Governance

Governance exists to translate constitutional authority into enforceable rules, controls, and decision boundaries.

It is not optional.
It is not advisory.
It is not a technical convenience layer.

Governance is the mechanism that prevents:

* Arbitrary power
* Technical overreach
* Informal decision-making
* Security erosion over time

---

## 2. Principle of Explicit Authority

No action is permitted without explicit authority.

If authority is not documented, it is assumed absent.

This applies to:

* Individuals
* Teams
* Automation
* External partners
* AI-assisted systems

---

## 3. Principle of Least Power

Actors are granted:

* Only the authority strictly required
* For the shortest duration necessary
* With the narrowest possible scope

Convenience, speed, or seniority do not justify expanded power.

---

## 4. Separation of Governance and Execution

Governance defines **what is allowed**.
Operations define **how it is executed**.

No individual or system may:

* Define rules and execute them unchecked
* Approve its own exceptions
* Audit its own behavior

---

## 5. Decision Formalization

All non-trivial decisions must be formalized as one of the following:

* **ADR (Architecture Decision Record)**
  For architectural, systemic, or strategic decisions.

* **TTX (Tabletop Exercise)**
  For risk, incident, crisis, or cross-domain scenarios.

Undocumented decisions are invalid by default.

---

## 6. Risk Ownership

Every risk must have:

* A named owner
* A documented acceptance or mitigation
* A defined review cycle

Unowned risks are governance failures.

---

## 7. Change Control

No change enters production or institutional reality without:

1. Documented intent
2. Impact analysis (security, legal, operational)
3. Approval within scope of authority
4. Traceable implementation
5. Post-change verification

Emergency changes remain subject to retrospective governance.

---

## 8. Observability as Governance

Observability is not a technical luxury.
It is a governance requirement.

Governance requires:

* Logs
* Metrics
* Evidence
* Timelines
* Integrity controls

What cannot be observed cannot be governed.

---

## 9. Compliance Inheritance

Compliance flows downward:

* Constitution → Governance → Strategy → Operations → Technology

Technical compliance without governance compliance is invalid.

---

## 10. Language and Authority

This document is authoritative in **English**.

Translations:

* Support jurisdictional alignment
* Do not override the master version

Conflicts are resolved by escalation to the constitutional layer.

---

## 11. Enforcement

Governance is enforced through:

* Technical controls
* Process constraints
* Audit mechanisms
* Human accountability

Repeated governance violations constitute a systemic risk.

---

## 12. Final Statement

Governance is not overhead.

Governance is the system’s immune response.

Without governance, systems decay.
